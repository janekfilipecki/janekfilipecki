![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-purple?style=for-the-badge&logo=react)
![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-purple?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript)

In this project me and my team set out to build a contest management supporting platform for the BoWarto foundation. We built a web app using django and React that enables the foundation to greatly simplify their workflow.
